# model to structure interface topics 

A diagram in draw.io format is made available with this repository. The aim of the diagram is to present various aspects of an interface in a structured manner. This is useful when starting an interface project or joining during such a project because you can derive the right questions from the diagram. In this context, the term interface refers to interfaces between systems or software components.
